A two-dimensional cavity is filled with an incompressible Newtonian fluid. The fluid is driven by the lid moving with a constant velocity U. This problem is widely used as a benchmark to validate CFD models due to its simple geometry but nontrivial flow solution.

In this project I numerically solve the cavity flow using the projection method.
